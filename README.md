# DataBricksHackathon
Welcome to the GitHub page of **Academatch**!  
To help with understanding the contents of this repository, here is some guiding information:
- `DataBricks_Code.ipynb1`: code for web-scraping the arxiv API for research abstracts.
- `Embeddings (2).ipynb`: code for applying the DistilBERT embeddings to convert the abstracts into vectors and storing the vectors in the Pinecone vector database.
- `main.py`: main code for the Academatch website.
- `static`: folder with the Academatch logo, dataset, and css files.
- `templates`: folder with the html files for the Academatch website.
  
This web application can unfortunately only be run locally as we had difficulties with hosting a dynamic webpage. Hopefully, we will eventually be able to host this application on a server.
