Those measurements, however, are costly to produce,especially in recordings that change throughout long periods of time. However,existing annotated databases for ECG delineation are small, being insufficientin size and in the array of pathological conditions they represent. Thisarticle delves has two main contributions. First, a pseudo-synthetic datageneration algorithm was developed, based in probabilistically composing ECGtraces given \"pools\" of fundamental segments, as cropped from the originaldatabases, and a set of rules for their arrangement into coherent synthetictraces. The generation of conditions is controlled by imposing expert knowledgeon the generated trace, which increases the input variability for training themodel. Second, two novel segmentation-based loss functions have been developed,which attempt at enforcing the prediction of an exact number of independentstructures and at producing closer segmentation boundaries by focusing on areduced number of samples. The best performing model obtained an $F_1$-score of99.38\\\\% and a delineation error of $2.19 \\\\pm 17.73$ ms and $4.45 \\\\pm 18.32$ msfor all wave\\'s fiducials (onsets and offsets, respectively), as averaged acrossthe P, QRS and T waves for three distinct freely available databases. Theexcellent results were obtained despite the heterogeneous characteristics ofthe tested databases, in terms of lead configurations (Holter, 12-lead),sampling frequencies ($250$, $500$ and $2,000$ Hz) and representedpathophysiologies (e.g., different types of arrhythmias, sinus rhythm withstructural heart disease), hinting at its generalization capabilities, whileoutperforming current state-of-the-art delineation approaches.',\n",

However, measuring and assessing indicators of urbandesign and transport features at high resolution worldwide to enable citycomparisons is challenging due to limited availability of official, highquality, and comparable spatial data, as well as spatial analysis toolsoffering customizable frameworks for indicator construction and analysis.

It presents a generalized method to consistently measurepedestrian accessibility at high resolution and spatially aggregated scale, toallow for both within- and between-city analyses. The open source and open datamethods developed in this study can be extended to other cities worldwide tosupport local planning and policymaking.

A paramagnetic behavior is observed in reduced samplesusing first principles calculations and quantitative magnetometry. The observedanomalous Hall effect follows the oxygen vacancy-induced magnetizationresponse, suggesting that the localized magnetic moments of the oxygenvacancies scatter conduction electrons asymmetrically and give rise toanomalous Hall effect. The anomalous Hall conductivity becomes insensitive toscattering rate in the low temperature limit (T<5 K), implying that the Berrycurvature of the electrons on the Fermi surface controls the anomalous Halleffect.

Within thisunusual quantum paraelectric phase, superconductivity persists despiteextremely dilute carrier densities. Ferroelectric fluctuations have beensuspected to play a role in the origin of superconductivity by contributing toelectron pairing. To investigate this possibility, we used optical secondharmonic generation to measure the doping and temperature dependence of theferroelectric order parameter in compressively strained SrTiO$_3$ thin films.At low temperatures, we uncover a spontaneous out-of-plane ferroelectricpolarization with an onset that correlates perfectly with normal-stateelectrical resistivity anomalies.

The temperature of the transitionsystematically depends on the carrier density, which is tuned from ~ 1x10^14cm^-2 to 3x10^14 cm^-2 by changing the SmTiO3 thickness. Analysis of thetransport properties shows non-Fermi liquid behavior and mass enhancement asthe carrier density is lowered. We compare the MIT characteristics with thoseof known MITs in other materials systems and show that they are distinctlydifferent in several aspects. We tentatively conclude that both long rangeCoulomb interactions and the fixed charge at the polar interface are likely toplay a role in this MIT.

From the ensembles, the southern AEWstormtrack was most sensitive to the reduction of the Ethiopian highlands.Energy budgets showed that diminished diabatic heating associated withprecipitating convection was the likely driver of the weaker AEWs. Baroclinicoverturning was the dominant pathway for this response. The northern AEWstormtrack was most sensitive to the reduction of the Hoggar and Tibestimountains.

              " 'It is well known that rapid changes in tropical cyclone motion occur duringinteraction with extratropical waves. While the translation speed has receivedmuch attention in the published literature, acceleration has not. Using a largedata sample of Atlantic tropical cyclones, we formally examine the compositesynoptic-scale patterns associated with tangential and \\\\curvature components oftheir acceleration. During periods of rapid tangential acceleration, thecomposite tropical cyclone moves poleward between an upstream trough anddownstream ridge of a developing extratropical wavepacket. The two systemssubsequently merge in a manner that is consistent with extratropicaltransition. During rapid curvature acceleration, a prominent downstream ridgepromotes recurvature of the tropical cyclone. In contrast, during rapidtangential or curvature deceleration, a ridge is located directly poleward ofthe tropical cyclone. Locally, this arrangement takes the form of acyclone-anticyclone vortex pair somewhat akin to a dipole block. On average,the tangential acceleration peaks 18 hours prior to extratropical transitionwhile the curvature acceleration peaks at recurvature. These findings confirmthat rapid acceleration of tropical cyclones is mediated by interaction withextratropical baroclinic waves. Furthermore, The tails of the distribution ofacceleration and translation speed show a robust reduction over the past 5decades. We speculate that these trends may reflect the poleward shift andweakening of extratropical Rossby waves.',\n",
              " 'We examine the group dynamic of African easterly waves (AEW) generated in arealistic, spatially non-homogeneous African easterly jet (AEJ) using anidealized general circulation model. Our objective is to investigate whetherthe limited zonal extent of the AEJ is an impediment to AEW development. Weconstruct a series of basic states using global reanalysis fields andinitialize waves via transient heating over West Africa. The dominant responseis a localized wavepacket that disperses upstream and downstream. The inclusionof a crude representation of boundary layer damping stabilizes the waves inmost cases. In some basic states, however, exponential growth occurs even inthe presence of damping. This shows that AEWs can occasionally emergespontaneously. The key result is that the wavepacket in almost all casesremains within the AEJ instead of being swept away. Drawing from other studies,this also suggests that even the damped waves can grow if coupled withadditional sources of energy such as moist convection and dust radiativefeedback. The wavepacket in the localized AEJ appears to satisfy a conditionfor absolute instability, a form of spatial hydrodynamic instability. However,this needs to be verified more rigorously. Our results also suggest that theintermittent nature of AEWs is mediated, not by transitions between convectiveand absolute instability, but likely by external sources such as propagatingequatorial wave modes',\n",

Simple a priori rejection schemes basedon the photometry alone can be tuned to recognise objects with wildlydiscrepant photo-z and to reduce the outlier fraction to < 0.25% with onlymodest loss of otherwise usable objects. Turning to the more challengingproblem of determining the mean redshift <z> of a set of galaxies to aprecision of 0.002(1+z) we argue that, for many different reasons, this is bestaccomplished by relying on the photo-z themselves rather than on the directmeasurement of <z> from spectroscopic redshifts of a representative subset ofthe galaxies. A simple adaptive scheme based on the statistical properties ofthe photo-z likelihood functions is shown to meet this stringent systematicrequirement. We also examine the effect of an imprecise correction for Galacticextinction and the effects of contamination by fainter over-lapping objects inphoto-z determination.

By injectingsimulated signals into the calibrated pixel data and processing those pixelsthrough the pipeline as normal, we quantify the detection probability ofsignals as a function of their signal strength and orbital period. In additionwe investigate the dependence of the detection efficiency on parameters of thetarget stars and their location in the Kepler field of view. We find that theend-of-mission version of the Kepler pipeline returns to a high overalldetection efficiency, averaging a 90-95% rate of detection for strong signalsacross a wide variety of parameter space. We find a weak dependence of thedetection efficiency on the number of transits contributing to the signal andthe orbital period of the signal, and a stronger dependence on the stellareffective temperature and correlated noise properties. We also find a weakdependence of the detection efficiency on the position within the field ofview. By restricting the Kepler stellar sample to stars with well-behavedcorrelated noise properties, we can define a set of stars with high detectionefficiency for future occurrence rate calculations.',\n",

Coherency arises from time-scaleseparation in the dynamics of synchronous generators, where generator statesinside a coherent area synchronize over a fast time-scale due to strongercoupling, while the areas themselves synchronize over a slower time-scale dueto weaker coupling.

This paper addresses thechallenge of using Landsat data, particularly its 30m spatial resolution, formonitoring three-dimensional urban densification. We compare temporal andspatial transferability of an adapted DeepLab model with a simple fullyconvolutional network (FCN) and a texture-based random forest (RF) model to mapurban density in the two morphological dimensions: horizontal (compact, open,sparse) and vertical (high rise, low rise). We test whether a model trained onthe 2014 data can be applied to 2006 and 1995 for Denmark, and examine whetherwe could use the model trained on the Danish data to accurately map otherEuropean cities. Our results show that an implementation of deep networks andthe inclusion of multi-scale contextual information greatly improve theclassification and the model's ability to generalize across space and time.DeepLab provides more accurate horizontal and vertical classifications than FCNwhen sufficient training data is available. By using DeepLab, the F1 score canbe increased by 4 and 10 percentage points for detecting vertical urban growthcompared to FCN and RF for Denmark. For mapping the other European cities withtraining data from Denmark, DeepLab also shows an advantage of 6 percentagepoints over RF for both the dimensions. The resulting maps across the years1985 to 2018 reveal different patterns of urban growth between Copenhagen andAarhus, the two largest cities in Denmark, illustrating that those cities haveused various planning policies in addressing population growth and housingsupply challenges. In summary, we propose a transferable deep learning approachfor automated, long-term mapping of urban form from Landsat images.\",\n",

Despite the widespread use of open-access 30m Landsat imagery,their utility for landslide detection is often limited when separatinglandslides from other anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we produce landslidemaps retrospectively from 1998 to 2017 for landslide-prone and highly populatedTaiwan (35,874 km2). To improve classification accuracy of landslides, weintegrate nighttime light imagery from the Defense Meteorological SatelliteProgram (DMSP) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), withmulti-seasonal daytime optical Landsat time-series, and digital elevation datafrom the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer(ASTER). We employed a non-parametric machine-learning classifier, randomforest, to classify the satellite imagery. The classifier was trained with datafrom three years (2005, 2010, and 2015), and was validated with an independentreference sample from twelve years. Our results demonstrated that combiningnighttime light data and multi-seasonal imagery significantly improved theclassification (p<0.001), compared to conventional methods based onsingle-season optical imagery. The results confirmed that the developedclassification model enabled mapping of landslides across Taiwan over a longperiod with annual overall accuracy varying between 96% and 97%, user's andproducer's accuracies between 73% and 86%. Spatiotemporal analysis of thelandslide inventories from 1998 to 2017 revealed different temporal patterns oflandslide activities, showing those areas where landslides were persistent andother areas where landslides tended to reoccur after vegetation regrowth. Insum, we provide a robust method to detect long-term landslide activities basedon freely available satellite imagery, which can be applied elsewhere.\",\n",

However, there is still a lack of study on how to distillbetween heterogeneous detectors. In this paper, we empirically find that betterFPN features from a heterogeneous teacher detector can help the studentalthough their detection heads and label assignments are different. However,directly aligning the feature maps to distill detectors suffers from twoproblems. First, the difference in feature magnitude between the teacher andthe student could enforce overly strict constraints on the student. Second, theFPN stages and channels with large feature magnitude from the teacher modelcould dominate the gradient of distillation loss, which will overwhelm theeffects of other features in KD and introduce much noise. To address the aboveissues, we propose to imitate features with Pearson Correlation Coefficient tofocus on the relational information from the teacher and relax constraints onthe magnitude of the features. Our method consistently outperforms the existingdetection KD methods and works for both homogeneous and heterogeneousstudent-teacher pairs. Furthermore, it converges faster.

Thisproblem, database reformulation, is important for many applications, includingdata warehousing and query optimization. We give complexity results andalgorithms for database reformulation in presence of constraints, forconjunctive queries, views, and rewritings and for several types ofconstraints, including functional and inclusion dependencies.

(Under set semantics, both query answers and storedrelations are treated as sets.)  In the context of the above Query-Reformulation Problem, we develop acomprehensive framework for equivalence of CQ queries under bag and bag-setsemantics in presence of embedded dependencies, and make a number of conceptualand technical contributions. Specifically, we develop equivalence tests for CQqueries in presence of arbitrary sets of embedded dependencies under bag andbag-set semantics, under the condition that chase [9] under set semantics(set-chase) on the inputs terminates. We also present equivalence tests foraggregate CQ queries in presence of embedded dependencies.

Our result solves inthe positive the decidability problem of determining combined-semanticsequivalence for pairs of explicit-wave CQ queries. That is, for an arbitrarypair of combined-semantics CQ queries, it is decidable (i) to determine whethereach of the queries is explicit wave, and (ii) to determine, in case bothqueries are explicit wave, whether or not they are combined-semanticsequivalent, by using our syntactic criterion.

Construing formula trees as the cotrees of cographs, we may statesemantic notions such as evaluation and entailment in purely graph-theoreticterms, whence we recover the definition of BGL. Naturally, it is conservativeover usual Boolean logic.  Our contributions are the following:  (1) We give a natural semantics of BGL based on Boolean relations, i.e. it isa multivalued semantics, and show adequacy of this semantics for thecorresponding notions of entailment. (2) We show that the complexity ofevaluation is NP-complete for arbitrary graphs (as opposed to ALOGTIME-completefor formulas), while entailment is $\\\\Pi^p_2$-complete (as opposed tocoNP-complete for formulas). (3) We give a 'recursive' algorithm for evaluationby induction on the modular decomposition of graphs. (Though this is notpolynomial-time, cf. point (2) above). (4) We characterise evaluation in agame-theoretic setting, in terms of both static and sequentical strategies,extending the classical notion of positional game forms beyond cographs. (5) Wegive an axiomatisation of BGL, inspired by deep-inference proof theory, andshow soundness and completeness for the corresponding notions of entailment.  One particular feature of the graph-theoretic setting is that it escapescertain no-go theorems such as a recent result of Das and Strassburger, thatthere is no linear axiomatisation of the linear fragment of Boolean logic(equivalently the multiplicative fragment of Japaridze's Computability Logic orBlass' game semantics for Mutliplicative Linear Logic).\",\n",

However, individual participants might not get maximum value fromtheir match and reject it to form matches (called blocking groups) themselves,thereby bypassing the platform. This paper considers the bipartite matchingproblem in MaaS marketplaces in a dynamic environment and proposesapproximately stable matching solutions using mechanism design and mathematicalprogramming approaches to limit the formation of blocking groups. Matching isbased on non-strict, incomplete and interdependent preferences of participantsover contracts enabling negotiations between both sides. Empirical simulationsare used to test the mechanisms in a simulated 3D printing marketplace and toevaluate the impact of stability on its performance.

Using thisordering, we show that input sequences that are more efficient for MCMCsampling also lead to smaller covariance of the errors for SGD algorithms inthe limit. This also suggests that an arbitrarily weighted MSE of SGD iteratesin the limit becomes smaller when driven by more efficient chains. Our findingis of particular interest in applications such as decentralized optimizationand swarm learning, where SGD is implemented in a random walk fashion on theunderlying communication graph for cost issues and/or data privacy. Wedemonstrate how certain non-Markovian processes, for which typical mixing-timebased non-asymptotic bounds are intractable, can outperform their Markoviancounterparts in the sense of efficiency ordering for SGD. We show the utilityof our method by applying it to gradient descent with shuffling and mini-batchgradient descent, reaffirming key results from existing literature under aunified framework.

Furthermore, thevariance of the error is smaller when using our tensor-based method. While thecomputational cost of our method is comparable to similar vectorized methods,it reduces the storage cost by several orders of magnitude. The reduced storagecost becomes even more pronounced as the dimension of the flow increases.

Due to the short-term character ofthe prediction, these wave groups do not interact and therefore their dynamicscan be characterized individually. Using direct numerical simulations of thegoverning envelope equations we precompute the expected maximum elevation foreach of those wave groups.

We seek the triggers as the probabilistically feasible solutions of anappropriately constrained optimization problem, where the function to bemaximized is a system observable exhibiting intermittent extreme bursts. Theconstraints are imposed to ensure the physical admissibility of the optimalsolutions, i.e., significant probability for their occurrence under the naturalflow of the dynamical system. We apply the method to a body-forcedincompressible Navier--Stokes equation, known as the Kolmogorov flow. We findthat the intermittent bursts of the energy dissipation are independent of theexternal forcing and are instead caused by the spontaneous transfer of energyfrom large scales to the mean flow via nonlinear triad interactions. The globalmaximizer of the corresponding variational problem identifies the responsibletriad, hence providing a precursor for the occurrence of extreme dissipationevents. Specifically, monitoring the energy transfers within this triad, allowsus to develop a data-driven short-term predictor for the intermittent bursts ofenergy dissipation.

              " 'With an increasing number of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) discovered thequestion of their origin remains open and causes heated debates in thesupernova community. Currently, there are three proposed mechanisms for SLSNe:(1) pair-instability supernovae (PISN), (2) magnetar-driven supernovae, and (3)models in which the supernova ejecta interacts with a circumstellar materialejected before the explosion. Based on current observations of SLSNe, the PISNorigin has been disfavoured for a number of reasons. Many PISN models provideoverly broad light curves and too reddened spectra, because of massive ejectaand a high amount of nickel. In the current study we re-examine PISN propertiesusing progenitor models computed with the GENEC code. We calculate supernovaexplosions with FLASH and light curve evolution with the radiationhydrodynamics code STELLA. We find that high-mass models (200 and 250 solarmasses) at relatively high metallicity (Z=0.001) do not retain hydrogen in theouter layers and produce relatively fast evolving PISNe Type I and might besuitable to explain some SLSNe. We also investigate uncertainties in lightcurve modelling due to codes, opacities, the nickel-bubble effect andprogenitor structure and composition.',\n",

These GW signals carryinformation from the heart of these catacylsmic events, where matter reachesnuclear densities. Recent studies have shown that it may be possible to inferproperties of the proto-neutron star (PNS) via gravitational waves generated byhydrodynamic perturbations of the PNS. However, we lack a comprehensiveunderstanding of how these relationships may change with the properties ofcore-collapse supernovae. In this work, we build a self-consistent suite ofover 1000 exploding core-collapse supernovae from a grid of progenitor massesand metallicities combined with six different nuclear equations of state.Performing a linear perturbation analysis on each model, we compute theresonant gravitational-wave frequencies of the PNS, and we motivate atime-agnostic method for identifying characteristic frequencies of the dominantgravitational-wave emission. From this, we identify two characteristicfrequencies, of the early- and late-time signal, that measure the surfacegravity of the cold remnant neutron star, and simultaneously constrain the hotnuclear equation of state. However, we find that the details of thecore-collapse supernova model, such as the treatment of gravity or the neutrinotransport, and whether it explodes, noticeably change the magnitude andevolution of the PNS eigenfrequencies.',\n",

Our model allows us to obtain a relationbetween the deterministic parameters of the target model and statisticalmoments of the SAR image. We assume a regular shape of the antenna trajectory,and our model targets are localized in at least one space-time coordinate; thispermits analytical formulation for statistical moments of the image. Theproblem of reconstruction of coordinate-delay reflectivity function is reducedto that of discrimination between instantaneous and delayed scatterers; for thelatter problem, the maximum likelihood based image processing procedure hasbeen developed.

The white phase will not beactivated under low CAV penetration rates, where vehicles must wait for greensignals. We have formulated this problem as a distributed mixed-integernon-linear program and developed a methodology to form an agreement among allvehicles on their trajectories and signal timing parameters. The agreement ontrajectories is reached through an iterative process, where CAVs update theirtrajectory based on shared trajectory of other vehicles to avoid collisions andshare their trajectory with other vehicles. Additionally, the agreement onsignal timing parameters is formed through a voting process where the mostvoted feasible signal timing parameters are selected. The numerical experimentsindicate that the proposed methodology can efficiently control vehiclemovements at signalized intersections under various CAV market shares.

Various scenarios are defined based on different market penetrationrates of these four vehicle types. AVs are assumed to move more cautiouslycompared to human drivers. CVs and CAVs are supposed to receive informationabout the future state of traffic lights and adjust their speeds to avoidstopping at the intersection. As a result, their movements are expected to besmoother with a lower number of stops. The effects of these vehicle types inmixed traffic are investigated in terms of saturation headway, capacity, traveltime, delay, and queue length in different lane groups of an intersection. APython script code developed by Vissim is used to provide the communicationbetween the signal controller and CVs and CAVs to adjust their speedsaccordingly. The results show that increasing CV and CAV market penetrationrate reduces saturation headway and consequently increases capacity atsignalized intersections.

As such, the model couldgenerate post-radiation FDG-PET image outcome predictions with possibletime-series transition from pre-radiotherapy image states to post-radiotherapystates. The proposed method was developed using 64 oropharyngeal patients withpaired FDG-PET studies before and after 20Gy delivery (2Gy/daily fraction) byIMRT.

However, interpolations introduceperturbation to the finite-difference discretization, which causes numericalinstability for time-stepping schemes used to advance the resultedsemi-discrete system. To address the instability, we propose to add afourth-order hyper-dissipation to the spatially discretized system to stabilizeits time integration; this additional dissipation term captures the essentialupwinding effect of the original upwind scheme. The investigation of strategiesfor incorporating the upwind dissipation term into several time-steppingschemes (both explicit and implicit) leads to the development of four novelalgorithms.

The dynamics of 1) MR images afterinteractions with DNN and 2) segmentation formation can be visualized aftersolving ODE. An accumulative contribution curve (ACC) was designed toquantitatively evaluate the utilization of each MRI by DNN towards the finalsegmentation results. The proposed neural ODE model was demonstrated using 369glioma patients with a 4-modality mp-MRI protocol: T1, contrast-enhanced T1(T1-Ce), T2, and FLAIR. Three neural ODE models were trained to segmentenhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT). The key MRmodalities with significant utilization by DNN were identified based on ACCanalysis. Segmentation results by DNN using only the key MR modalities werecompared to the ones using all 4 MR modalities. Results: All neural ODE modelssuccessfully illustrated image dynamics as expected. ACC analysis identifiedT1-Ce as the only key modality in ET and TC segmentations, while both FLAIR andT2 were key modalities in WT segmentation.

These provide an effective notion of approximatedifferential operators, with a strong algebraic structure. We introduce theapproximate Greatest Common Right Divisor Problem (GCRD) of differentialpolynomials, as a non-commutative generalization of the well-studiedapproximate GCD problem.  Given two differential polynomials, we present an algorithm to find nearbydifferential polynomials with a non-trivial GCRD, where nearby is defined withrespect to a suitable coefficient norm. Intuitively, given two lineardifferential polynomials as input, the (approximate) GCRD problem correspondsto finding the (approximate) differential polynomial whose solution space isthe intersection of the solution spaces of the two inputs.  The approximate GCRD problem is proven to be locally well-posed. A methodbased on the singular value decomposition of a differential Sylvester matrix isdeveloped to produce an initial approximation of the GCRD. With a sufficientlygood initial approximation, Newton iteration is shown to converge quadraticallyto an optimal solution. Finally, sufficient conditions for existence of asolution to the global problem are presented along with examples demonstratingthat no solution exists when these conditions are not satisfied.',\n",

As a result,physicists have increasingly turned to model-independent strategies as tools insearching for a wide range of possible BSM effects. In this paper, we describethe Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SM-EFT) and analyse it in thecontext of the philosophical discussions about models, theories, and(bottom-up) effective field theories. We find that while the SM-EFT is aquantum field theory, assisting experimentalists in searching for deviationsfrom the SM, in its general form it lacks some of the characteristic featuresof models. Those features only come into play if put in by hand or prompted byempirical evidence for deviations. Employing different philosophical approachesto models, we argue that the case study suggests not to take a view on modelsthat is overly permissive because it blurs the lines between the differentstages of the SM-EFT research strategies and glosses over particle physicists'motivations for undertaking this bottom-up approach in the first place. Lookingat EFTs from the perspective of modelling does not require taking a stance onsome specific brand of realism or taking sides in the debate between reductionand emergence into which EFTs have recently been embedded.\",\n",

We adopt a general definition of a moving frame as anequivariant map from the space of submanifolds to the group itself andintroduce two algorithms, which simplify the construction of such maps. Thefirst algorithm is applicable when the group factors as a product of twosubgroups $G=BA$, allowing us to use moving frames and differential invariantsfor the groups $A$ and $B$ in order to construct a moving frame anddifferential invariants for $G$. This approach produces the relations among theinvariants of $G$ and its subgroups. We use the groups of the projective, theaffine and the Euclidean transformations on the plane to illustrate thealgorithm. We also introduce a recursive algorithm, allowing, provided thegroup action satisfies certain conditions, to construct differential invariantsorder by order, at each step normalizing more and more of the group parameters,at the end obtaining a moving frame for the entire group. The development ofthis algorithm has been motivated by the applications of the moving framemethod to the problems of the equivalence and symmetry of polynomials underlinear changes of variables. In the complex or real case these problems can bereduced and, in theory, completely solved as the problem of the equivalence ofsubmanifolds.

              " 'Weakly-supervised anomaly detection aims at learning an anomaly detector froma limited amount of labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. Recent worksbuild deep neural networks for anomaly detection by discriminatively mappingthe normal samples and abnormal samples to different regions in the featurespace or fitting different distributions. However, due to the limited number ofannotated anomaly samples, directly training networks with the discriminativeloss may not be sufficient. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novelstrategy to transform the input data into a more meaningful representation thatcould be used for anomaly detection. Specifically, we leverage an autoencoderto encode the input data and utilize three factors, hidden representation,reconstruction residual vector, and reconstruction error, as the newrepresentation for the input data. This representation amounts to encode a testsample with its projection on the training data manifold, its direction to itsprojection and its distance to its projection. In addition to this encoding, wealso propose a novel network architecture to seamlessly incorporate those threefactors. From our extensive experiments, the benefits of the proposed strategyare clearly demonstrated by its superior performance over the competitivemethods.',\n",

Despite tremendous progresses, one downside of such ML/DLmodels is that they generally rely on large-scale labeled datasets fortraining, and the performance of such models is strongly influenced by the sizeand quality of available labeled data samples. In addition, collecting,processing, and labeling such large-scale datasets is extremely costly andtime-consuming, partially due to the rising cost in human labor. Therefore,developing label-efficient ML/DL methods for agricultural applications hasreceived significant interests among researchers and practitioners.

              " 'We propose a method to visualize vortex cores based on manipulation of thepressure field produced by isolated vortices in incompressible flow. Underideal conditions the function $D=2|\\\\nabla P|/\\\\nabla^2 P$ yields an approximatedistance to vortex centerlines. As opposed to local methods to identifycoherent structures, isosurfaces of $D$ produce a field of vortex tubesequidistant to the vortex core center which, ideally, are independent of vortexintensity or size. In contrast to other line-vortex identification methods,which typically rely on algorithms to detect vortex core lines and frequentlyneed complex implementations, the proposed method can be computed from thelocal Eulerian velocity and pressure fields as easily as vortex identificationmethods such as the $Q$ and $\\\\lambda_2$ criteria. $2|\\\\nabla P|/\\\\nabla^2 P$results in the exact distance to the core center for a Rankine vortex and is ingeneral valid for the region of a vortex where there is pure rotation, yieldingan approximation to the distance farther from the core in other simpleone-dimensional vortex models.

Inspired by the recent finding that astrocyte GTPase-activatingprotein (G-protein)-coupled receptors could be involved in stochastic epilepticseizures, we proposed a neuron-astrocyte network model, incorporating the noiseof the astrocytic second messager, inositol triphosphate (IP3) which ismodulated by the G-protein)-coupled receptor activation. Based on this model,we have statistically analysed the transitions of epileptic seizures byperforming tens of simulation trials. Our simulation results show that theincrease of the IP3 noise intensity induces the depolarization-block epilepticseizures together with an increase in neuronal firing frequency. Meanwhile, abistable state of neuronal firing emerges under certain noise intensity, duringwhich the neuronal firing pattern switches between regular sparse spiking andepileptic seizure states. This random presence of epileptic seizures is absentwhen the noise intensity continues to increase, accompanying with an increasein the epileptic depolarization block duration. The simulation results alsoshed light on the fact that calcium signals in astrocytes play significantroles in the pattern formations of the epileptic seizure. Our results provide apotential pathway for understanding the epileptic randomness.',\n",
